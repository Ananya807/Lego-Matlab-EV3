# Lego-Matlab-EV3
Code and documentation of Lego Ev3

1. Project Overview

This project involves designing and programming a LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotic vehicle using MATLAB. The vehicle is specifically created to assist individuals with physical disabilities, providing an accessible and user-friendly way to control movement and direction.
The project demonstrates how robotics and assistive technology can improve independence and mobility for people with limited physical capabilities.

2. Objectives
To create a vehicle that can be easily controlled by users with limited mobility.
To implement MATLAB-based control for precision and accessibility.
To explore the use of color detection, sensors, and automatic navigation for user assistance.
To contribute to inclusive and adaptive technology through educational robotics

3. Features
Color Detection: The robot recognizes specific colors (red, blue, green) to perform actions like stopping, turning, or changing modes.
Accessible Control System: Simplified input methods for ease of use.
Automatic Navigation: Uses sensors to detect obstacles and adjust course.
MATLAB Integration: The entire logic and control algorithms are written in MATLAB, making it compatible with academic and research environments.

4. Hardware and Software Requirements

Hardware:
LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Brick
EV3 motors and sensors (color sensor, ultrasonic sensor, etc.)
Battery pack and cables

Software:
MATLAB (with LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Support Package)
Simulink (optional, for model-based design)

5. How to Run the Code
Install MATLAB and the EV3 Support Package.
Connect your EV3 brick to your computer via Bluetooth.
Run the script — it will connect to the EV3 and execute the programmed movements.
Follow the color path or obstacle course designed for testing accessibility behavior.
